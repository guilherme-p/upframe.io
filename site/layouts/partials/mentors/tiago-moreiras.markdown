A computer fanatic and analytical thinker, Tiago loves to turn the whole world into a giant spreadsheet. His college studies started at ISCTE, where he graduated in Computer Science. At the same university, he completed his Masters of Managing Information Systems, already working for Novabase as a consultant. He worked at the consultancy firm for 6 years.

Another of his passions is Product Management so, in 2015, he joined Landing.Jobs. With Tiago as Head of Product, the Portuguese startup is an European tech recruitment marketplace, that helps candidates finding their next job and manage their careers.

Out of the office, Tiago is a book junkie, music lover, enthusiastic traveler and a creative writer: throw him a good challenge and watch his eyes fill with joy.
