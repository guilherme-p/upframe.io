Never stuck in one place, David is literally changing the way we use the web every day at Protocol Labs as a Peer-to-Peer Software Engineer. He also lectures at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico and organises LXJS - Lisbon JavaScript Conference. Besides that, David founded StartupScholarship (startupscholarship.org).

Need advice on how to get started with web development or on how to ride a longboard? Even miles away, David will be always eager to help.
