<h3>What is Upframe?</h3>

<p>Upframe connects students to established tech entrepreneurs providing them tools and empowering them to become more entrepreneurial.</p>

<p>More than an organization, Upframe is a community made by people who believe in creating an impact in the life of others. People that acknowledge the fact that failing is just another word for growing. Unlike other organisations made by students and attached to universities, we can pride ourselves of being independent and working just like any early stage startup would.</p>
