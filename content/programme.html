                    Providing an attractive value proposition is always a
                    challenge, so you will be presented to some mechanisms and

                <p>
                    By the end of the 6 weeks, it is expected that you have an
                    Minimum Viable Product, i.e., a product with enough
                    characteristics to be user tested and gather some feedback.
                    It can be as simple as a Typeform, a spreadsheet or a
                    Facebook group. Each case is different and we are here to
                    help you figure it out!

                <span class="question">Who is going to guide our masterclasses?</span>
                <p>
                    All masterclasses, workshops and exercises  will be guided
                    by our mentors. They are the ones who will guide you through
                    concepts, provide you with useful tools and enhance the
                    development of a problem-solving mindset.
