    <h2>Applying Conditions</h2>

    <label for="1q1">Is there a limit age or background to participate?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="1q1">

    <p>No. We want smart motivated people, eager to know more, and that believe working in teams and sharing knowledge is the way to success. We give much more weight to your personal characteristics, rather than your age or university degree. This information is asked in the registration form just for statistical purposes.</p>

    <label for="1q2">I don't have an idea. Can I participate?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="1q2">

    <p>Yes! There is no requirement whatsoever to have an idea to join our programme. You will participate in the analysis of your colleagues' ideas and problems, as well as in the development of the products/services that may come up during the programme.</p>

    <label for="1q3">Can I work alone on my idea?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="1q3">

    <p>No. This is a team-based journey, if you do not desire to work in a team, our programme is not the best fit.</p>

    <label for="1q4">Can apply as a team?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="1q4">

    <p>No, you can come with friends but all have to apply individually.</p>

    <label for="1q5">I already have a business developed, does it make sense to participate?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="1q5">

    <p>As long as you are conscious that you may not work on your idea throughout the programme, there is no problem. Even if you already have a business working, the concepts and processes taught are very valuable even at a later stage in a startup.</p>

    <h2>Application Process</h2>

    <label for="2q1">How is the paying method?</label>
    <input id="2q1" type="checkbox">

    <p>By now, we only have a Paypal payment option.</p>

    <label for="2q2">How is the registration process?</label>
    <input id="2q2" type="checkbox">

    <p>To enrol in our programme you simply have to click <a href="/programme">here</a>. Check the application detailed process <a href="/apply">here</a>.</p>

    <label for="2q3">Is there any benefit of applying earlier?</label>
    <input id="2q3" type="checkbox">

    <p>Besides the lower price, we are limited to 18 participants and we are analysing applications (registration form submissions) right as they arrive in our inbox. The earlier you apply, the higher the chance of getting a seat in our programme.</p>

    <label for="2q4">How can I prepare for your interview?</label>
    <input id="2q4" type="checkbox">

    <p>Don't be late and be yourself! Know by heart your music taste, favourite movies, if you prefer running or hitting the gym, which is your preferred writer and biggest dreams!</p>

    <label for="2q5">What will be analysed on the interview?</label>
    <input id="2q5" type="checkbox">

    <p>In the interview, there are several points that are going to be analysed, but it will be mostly centred around motivation to enter the programme, willingness to work in group and openness to work in other people's ideas and projects.</p>

    <h2>Enrolment</h2>

    <label for="3q1">Why didn't we accept your application?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="3q1">

    <p>Don't take our decision personally. We will be analysing dozens of applications for 18 spots, so we have to accept the people who we think will better capitalise their investment on our programme. What does this mean? We will choose the people who show most drive and motivation, show openness to step out of their comfort zone and take chances, people who want to meet new people and work with others.</p>

    <label for="3q2">Can I attend just to some workshops?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="3q2">

    <p>You will be enrolled for the entire programme, that includes Saturday's meetings and during-the-week mentor sessions and Q&A. It is imperative that you do not miss Saturday's sessions, since if you do, it will break your team's rhythm in the development of your idea. Furthermore, if you miss any schedule sessions, you will no get a refund.</p>

    <label for="3q3">Until when can I cancel my application and receive a refund?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="3q3">

This clear intention of withdrawal from the programme must be made through email, to hello@upframe.co. After that date, you may cancel your application but will not receive a refund.</p>

    <label for="4q3">What is the programme language?</label>
