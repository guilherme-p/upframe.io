After his International Relations degree, André started working in the Capital Markets Sector at leading companies such as CBRE and E&V Commercial.

His career turning point was when he moved to the startup ecosystem and was a Co-Founder of Table & Friends, a successful social reservation system. Nowadays, at Altar.io, he puts his passion at the service of his clients, crafting web and mobile products that make use of UX, solid software and good visualisation and use of customer and businesses data.

André loves setting up or running industry-specific disruptive businesses that aim to make life better and simpler for the user/end consumer, especially enjoying the thrills of creating product.
