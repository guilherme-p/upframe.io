Graduated in Management with a specialisation in Hotel Management, MÃ¡rio is Founder and CEO of Climber Hotel. "Climber" is not a random name, as Mario has already climbed Mont Blanc, Himalayas, Andes and Matterhorn.

His vast experience in this area is also due to the work he has developed at Four Seasons and Starwood Hotels chains, as well as two other Startups that he founded in the field of Tourism.
